## What is AI in simple words?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Think of it as teaching computers to recognize patterns, make decisions, and learn from experience.

When you ask Siri a question, unlock your phone with your face, or get product recommendations on Amazon, you're interacting with AI.

## AI in your daily life

You probably use AI multiple times every day:

- **Email:** Gmail's spam filter uses AI to block unwanted emails
- **Shopping:** Amazon and Flipkart recommend products based on your browsing history
- **Social Media:** Instagram and Facebook use AI to show you posts you'll likely engage with
- **Navigation:** Google Maps predicts traffic and suggests the fastest route

## Key Takeaways

- AI is everywhere in your daily digital life
- It's great at patterns and predictions, weak at common sense
- You don't need to code to use AI tools effectively
