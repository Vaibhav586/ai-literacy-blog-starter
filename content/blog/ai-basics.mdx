## What you will learn

- What people mean by AI, ML, and deep learning
- Where AI shows up in your daily life
- What AI is good at and where it fails

## What is AI in simple words?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Think of it as teaching computers to recognize patterns, make decisions, and learn from experience.

When you ask Siri a question, unlock your phone with your face, or get product recommendations on Amazon, you're interacting with AI.

## AI, machine learning, and deep learning

These terms often get mixed up:

- **AI** is the big umbrella—any system that mimics human intelligence
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a type of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed
- **Deep Learning** is a subset of ML that uses neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to process complex patterns

## AI in your daily life

You probably use AI multiple times every day:

- **Email:** Gmail's spam filter uses AI to block unwanted emails
- **Shopping:** Amazon and Flipkart recommend products based on your browsing history
- **Social Media:** Instagram and Facebook use AI to show you posts you'll likely engage with
- **Navigation:** Google Maps predicts traffic and suggests the fastest route
- **Entertainment:** Netflix recommends shows based on what you've watched

## What AI can and cannot do

### AI is good at:
- Recognizing patterns in large amounts of data
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Making predictions based on historical data
- Processing and understanding language (to a degree)

### AI struggles with:
- Common sense reasoning
- Understanding context outside its training data
- Creativity that requires true originality
- Tasks requiring empathy and emotional intelligence

## Try it now

1. Open any AI assistant you like (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
2. Paste this prompt:
   > "Explain AI to me as if I am 12 years old, using only examples from shopping and social media."
3. Compare the answer with what you just read.

## Key Takeaways

- AI is everywhere in your daily digital life
- It's great at patterns and predictions, weak at common sense
- You don't need to code to use AI tools effectively
- Understanding AI basics helps you use it responsibly
